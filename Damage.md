# Damage #
The damage system is based on the ancient Greek’s beliefs regarding human existence, where a person was measured by the strength and health of their mind, body, and spirit. The optimal case would be to have all three in equal amounts such that they could be represented by an equilateral triangle. Dealing and taking damage is handled through a series of check boxes, ten boxes for each of the three types of damage. Damage is counted by checking a number of boxes equal to the amount of damage dealt starting at the damage level noted by the weapon’s damage type and rating, and all boxes below that level. If a character has already taken damage beyond the indicated level the new damage is counted by checking off boxes on the next available damage type until all the damage is applied. Damage levels are Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Deadly.

In CCARPS damage comes in three forms; **Mental**, **Physical**, and **Spiritual**. 

Damage is represented as a series of three connected bars of ten boxes each. Box ten on the mental bar is connected to box one on the Physical bar, and box ten on the physical bar is connected to box one on the Spiritual bar.

**Damage overload** occurs when the normal damage bar for the given damage index is full, and more damage of the same type is dealt to a character. The overload damage is then applied to the next damage meter. When a character reaches 10 boxes of mental stun, that character will lose consciousness.

Once a character is unconscious they no longer take mental damage. Instead, further mental damage would overflow into physical damage, thereby increasing the characters physical damage count by the overflow amount. When a character takes deadly physical damage that character begins to die, any additional damage, mental, or physical, is applied to the spiritual damage meter.

Any character that has taken spiritual damage beyond the first medium box cannot be revived without the intervention of magic, or a trauma surgeon. When a character takes deadly spiritual damage no amount of medicine or magic can revive that character. A character is "fully dead" if all the spiritual boxes are marked. Anything less than ten boxes of spiritual damage is only "mostly dead" as defined by Miracle Max (*The Princess Bride*).

Damage comes from these primary sources: Stun/Shock/Bludgeoning, Cutting/Piercing, and Magical/Energy.

## Mental ##
Mental damage, also known as stun, shock, or surprise, is caused by things like flash bombs, magical attacks, punch to the face, etc, and can lead to unconsciousness. Mental damage is what happens when the character is subjected to a stun effect. Stun effects can come from any of the three sources.

## Physical ##
Physical damage comes primarily from physical or magical/energy attacks but it can also be caused by mental damage overload.

## Spiritual ##
Spiritual damage is primarily caused by Magical/Energy attacks but it can come from Physical damage overload.

## Damage Levels ##
* Light = one box
* Moderate = three boxes
* Serious = six boxes
* Deadly = ten boxes 

When a character reaches the first box on a given meter that character will take a -1 penalty to all target numbers. At the third box the character takes a -2 to all target numbers. At the sixth box the character takes a -3 to all target numbers. These penalties are cumulative; if a character has registered three physical and six mental damage the total penalty will be -1 + -2 + -3 for the mental damage plus -1 + -2 for a total penalty of -9. These penalties will remain until the damage is healed below the given level.

## Collateral Damage ##
In the case that a player misses an attack the GM rolls to hit all logically available targets, once for each possible target. The roll is made on an inverted attack roll scale.

* Beginner: roll 5d6
* Novice: roll 4d6
* Advanced: roll 3d6
* Master: roll 2d6

## Damage Recovery ##
Mental stun heals over time; physical damage heals with medical attention; and spiritual damage requires an act of faith, affirmation, or belief to heal.

Mental stun recovery time is equal to ten minutes times the number of damage boxes checked in all three damage indicators. i.e.: Sum up the checked boxes from all three rows, multiply the result by 10 minutes. A character with five boxes of mental stun, two boxes of physical damage and one box of spiritual damage marked would add five, two, and one and multiply the result by ten for a total of 80 minutes. (5 + 2 + 1) * 10 = 80 minutes.

Physical damage can be healed by the application of first aid for the first three boxes, if and only if there are no more than three boxes of physical damage marked. If four to seven boxes are marked a field medic with a standard field medical kit can heal the character. If eight to ten boxes are marked the character will need to be treated by a doctor in a hospital or medical clinic. In any case the recovery time is ten hours times the number of damage boxes checked in all three damage indicators divided by the tech level of the character rendering aid.

Spiritual damage is the most difficult to heal. Each point of spiritual damage marked will require a number of hours spent in the act of meditating, praying, or otherwise feeding the soul or spirit to heal. The amount of time is equal to ten hours times the number of spiritual damage boxes marked. The spiritual rebuilding exercise must be coordinated through the game master and must be in accordance with the character.s stated belief system.
