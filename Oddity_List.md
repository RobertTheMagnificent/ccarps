# List of Oddities #
All character traits are oddities; they are the things that make your character unique. While many, if not most, can be taken as a neutral trait. Some can be active and some can be passive, but they cannot be both. These changes are referred to as Prestige and Prejudice. Prestige will give active effects to your roll, such as reducing your target number in success tests, or adding modifier dice.

* Oddities are all character traits. A "normal" Oddity isn't in an extreme and may be passive or active.
* A Prestige Oddity is active and maintained by the character. 
* An Oddity Prejudice is a passive trait that can not be manipulated by the character.

**Ambidextrous, 5 points**  
You are equally effective with either hand and never suffer the usual -4 target number penalty when using your "off" hand.

**Animal Empathy, 5 points**  
You are quite talented at understanding animal motivations. When you come in contact with an animal, the GM rolls against your Perception and tells you the overall emotional state of the animal. You will know whether it is scared, hostile, hungry, etc. If it is under the control of another, this may also be revealed. Animal Empathy also allows you to use influence skills on animals.

**Catfall, 10 points**  
You fall with grace. Automatically subtract five yards from your fall immediately. This counds as an automatic Acrobatics success. Successful Dexterity rolls reduce damage from falls by half. Your limbs and body must be unbound and free to move while you fall.

**Combat Reflexes, 15 points**  
You are rarely surprise, and you have extraordinary reaction times. All active defense rolls gain +1 to target number. Fright checks gain +2 to target number, and you never "freeze" in surprise situations. Furthermore, you gain +6 to target number for waking up or recovering from a surprise attack or mental stun.

**Danger Sense, 15 points**  
Sometimes you just know when something bad is going to happen. The GM rolls once against your Perception (in secret), anytime you're in a situation involving ambush, impending doom, or similar. On a success, you gain enough warning that you can take action. On a critical success, you gain some detail as to the nature of the danger.

**Empathy, 15 points**  
You have a strong connection to the emotions of others. When you first meet someone or are reunited after an extended period, you may ask the GM to roll against your Intelligence. They will tell you what you "feel" about that person. If the roll fails, the GM will _lie_. This is great for figuring out loyalties, finding impotsters, etc.

**Enhanced Defenses, 5-15 points**
