# Combat #
The act of combat is represented as a series of skill tests. The attacker makes a success test against the related skill or attribute plus any attack modifiers. On success, the attacker stages up the damage using all applicable damage modifiers from skills, PPO, and weapon enchantments. Finally, the defender gets an opportunity to block, dodge, or parry the attack by making a success test against his or her reflex, plus any related skill modifiers, plus any defensive modifiers from armor and stages the damage down using the resulting value.

## Range and Reach ##
Range and reach are how far one can use projectiles or hit with melee weapons. A reach/range of zero (0) is equal to 3 feet (1 yard). Each point of reach/range is equal to an additional 3 feet.

<pre>
------------------------
Reach/Range	Distance
------------------------
0		3ft
1		6ft
2		9ft
...		...
8		24ft
9		27ft
10		30ft
</pre>

If the number is less than zero (0), there is a -1 penalty to target number, unless specified differenly by weapon type.

## Combat Sequence ##
**Step 1:** Attacker rolls against the base target number, plus any skill modifiers, plus any weapon attack modifiers.

**Step 2:** On success, attacker sums the total modifiers from weapon damage modifiers, skill damage modifiers, and PPO damage modifiers and reports the final damage stage to the defender.

**Step 3:** The defender makes a success test against the attacker's roll plus their chosen defensive skill modifier.

**Step 4:** The difference between the roll and the target number plus any armor bonuses is used to reduce the damage level of the attack. 

**Step 5:** Record the damage by marking each consecutive damage box starting at the lowest available box in the related damage type. If damage is reduced below one then no damage is recorded.

## Melee Example ##
**Set up** A character, having a hand-to-hand combat skill at level 6 (first novice level), wants to punch another character. The defender has an opportunity to react with a block, dodge, or parry depending on the choice of available defense skills. The attacker's target number to succeed in hitting the opponent is 6 for a moderately difficult task, plus the skill modifier for the attack skill used, plus any attack modifiers on the weapon used. In this case the base target number is 6, level modifier is 3, and weapon modifier 0 (brass knuckles have no modifier to attack), Final Target# = 6 + 3 + 0 = 9

**Step E1:** The attacking player rolls 3d6 with values 2, 3, and 6 then he or she sums the two lowest values (2 and 3) to get his or her chance of success (5). In this case the attack succeeds because the attack success of 5 is lower than the target number of 6. 

**Step E2:** The attacker stages up the damage. Brass knuckle's have damage index of [STR]+1M. Our attacker has a strength modifier of 4, and a skill modifier of 3, Sum all the values: 4+1+3 = 8. Use the total to stage the damage up.

**Step E3:** The defender, in this case, has enhanced reflexs providing a modifier of +1 and has a hand to hand skill at level 4 which gives him a modifier of +2 to parry. The defender's target number is the sum of the attacker's roll 5 plus reflex modifier 2 plus parry modifier 2 for a total of 9. The defender rolls two dice (see skill modifier table) based on her hand to hand skill and gets a 3 and a 4 then adds the two dice for a total of 7. Since 7 is less than 9 the parry is successful. 

**Step E4:** The defender subtracts the result from the target number (9 - 7 = 2) and adds her armor's damage resistance modifier of +2 against bludgeoning from her type II body armor, and  then uses the remaining points to stage the damage down. In this case the defender will use 4 points to stage the damage down.

**Step E5:** Apply the damage to the appropriate damage meterDamage of 8 minus defence of 4 = 4 damage. The damage type is determined by the weapon, in this case a fist does Mental damage (All blunt force damage will first register on the Mental meter)

**Note:** Critical rolls do not apply to damage rolls, If the attack roll was a critical success the final damage staging number is doubled. 

**Note:** When a player chooses to attack there are two options: General target, and Called shot. General target is an attack at a chosen target. A Called shot is an attack at a specific location or region of a chosen target.

## Damage ##
The damage system is based on the ancient Greek’s beliefs regarding human existence, where a person was measured by the strength and health of their mind, body, and spirit. The optimal case would be to have all three in equal amounts such that they could be represented by an equilateral triangle. Dealing and taking damage is handled through a series of check boxes, ten boxes for each of the three types of damage. Damage is counted by checking a number of boxes equal to the amount of damage dealt starting at the damage level noted by the weapon’s damage type and rating, and all boxes below that level. If a character has already taken damage beyond the indicated level the new damage is counted by checking off boxes on the next available damage type until all the damage is applied. Damage levels are Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Deadly.

In CCARPS damage comes in three forms; **Mental**, **Physical**, and **Spiritual**. 

Damage is represented as a series of three connected bars of ten boxes each. Box ten on the mental bar is connected to box one on the Physical bar, and box ten on the physical bar is connected to box one on the Spiritual bar.

**Damage overload** occurs when the normal damage bar for the given damage index is full, and more damage of the same type is dealt to a character. The overload damage is then applied to the next damage meter. When a character reaches 10 boxes of mental stun, that character will lose consciousness.

Once a character is unconscious they no longer take mental damage. Instead, further mental damage would overflow into physical damage, thereby increasing the characters physical damage count by the overflow amount. When a character takes deadly physical damage that character begins to die, any additional damage, mental, or physical, is applied to the spiritual damage meter.

Any character that has taken spiritual damage beyond the first medium box cannot be revived without the intervention of magic, or a trauma surgeon. When a character takes deadly spiritual damage no amount of medicine or magic can revive that character. A character is "fully dead" if all the spiritual boxes are marked. Anything less than ten boxes of spiritual damage is only "mostly dead" as defined by Miracle Max (*The Princess Bride*).

Damage comes from these primary sources: Stun/Shock/Bludgeoning, Cutting/Piercing, and Magical/Energy.

### Mental ###
Mental damage, also known as stun, shock, or surprise, is caused by things like flash bombs, magical attacks, punch to the face, etc, and can lead to unconsciousness. Mental damage is what happens when the character is subjected to a stun effect. Stun effects can come from any of the three sources.

### Physical ###
Physical damage comes primarily from physical or magical/energy attacks but it can also be caused by mental damage overload.

### Spiritual ###
Spiritual damage is primarily caused by Magical/Energy attacks but it can come from Physical damage overload.

### Damage Levels ###
* Light = one box
* Moderate = three boxes
* Serious = six boxes
* Deadly = ten boxes 

When a character reaches the first box on a given meter that character will take a -1 penalty to all target numbers. At the third box the character takes a -2 to all target numbers. At the sixth box the character takes a -3 to all target numbers. These penalties are cumulative; if a character has registered three physical and six mental damage the total penalty will be -1 + -2 + -3 for the mental damage plus -1 + -2 for a total penalty of -9. These penalties will remain until the damage is healed below the given level.

### Collateral Damage ###
In the case that a player misses an attack the GM rolls to hit all logically available targets, once for each possible target. The roll is made on an inverted attack roll scale.

* Beginner: roll 5d6
* Novice: roll 4d6
* Advanced: roll 3d6
* Master: roll 2d6

### Damage Recovery ###
Mental stun heals over time; physical damage heals with medical attention; and spiritual damage requires an act of faith, affirmation, or belief to heal.

Mental stun recovery time is equal to ten minutes times the number of damage boxes checked in all three damage indicators. i.e.: Sum up the checked boxes from all three rows, multiply the result by 10 minutes. A character with five boxes of mental stun, two boxes of physical damage and one box of spiritual damage marked would add five, two, and one and multiply the result by ten for a total of 80 minutes. (5 + 2 + 1) * 10 = 80 minutes.

Physical damage can be healed by the application of first aid for the first three boxes, if and only if there are no more than three boxes of physical damage marked. If four to seven boxes are marked a field medic with a standard field medical kit can heal the character. If eight to ten boxes are marked the character will need to be treated by a doctor in a hospital or medical clinic. In any case the recovery time is ten hours times the number of damage boxes checked in all three damage indicators divided by the tech level of the character rendering aid.

Spiritual damage is the most difficult to heal. Each point of spiritual damage marked will require a number of hours spent in the act of meditating, praying, or otherwise feeding the soul or spirit to heal. The amount of time is equal to ten hours times the number of spiritual damage boxes marked. The spiritual rebuilding exercise must be coordinated through the game master and must be in accordance with the character.s stated belief system.

## Hit Location Chart ##
When a player designates a target and launches a projectile, the player must roll below the modified target number in order to hit. if the player rolls above the target number the projectile completely misses.

**Shot from the Hip** In the case of a hit w/o a called shot, the gm rolls two hit dice (2D6) to determine where the projectile hits the target. the values, for a humanoid target, of each area of the body are as follows:
<pre>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
roll  | Area of impact
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2     | Head
3-4   | Chest / Upper back (lungs, heart, liver, etc.)
5-7   | Abdomen / Lower back (belly, pelvis, kidneys, etc.)
8-9   | Leg (closest to attacker / most reasonable of the two)
10-11 | Arm (closest to attacker / most reasonable of the two)
12    | Neck, buttocks/ass, groin (most reasonable for the situation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
**Called Shot Miss**
When a player designates an area to hit on a target, the player must roll below the modified target number to hit. if the player's roll is equal to or greater than the modified target number the players shot will miss. As you may have guessed, this is where Sir Issaic's first law comes in: "An object in motion tends to stay in motion", etc. etc. so that thing; fist, arrow, bullet must go somewhere. The following chart and 1d6 will help you figure out what force will cancel the motion of the object.

Imagine a circle cut into 6 slices (see image below) overlaid on the target with its center point on the called location. Now roll 1d6 and count the pie slices clockwise from the top to determine which direction the miss took. If it please you use the difference between the modified target number and the players roll to determine the magnatude in whatever units seem appropriate for the situation. Then let Sir Issaic prove his stuff by knocking the F out of the projectile and and into the unintended location; Newton's second law is the relationship Force equals mass times acceleration ( F = ma ). You can use your imagination for Newton's third law; "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."

(insert picture here)

**Ring of Fail**
In the case of the epic fail, all dice come up 6, we have a Ring of Fail. To use the ring of fail orient, the 12 segmented circle such that the number 1 position aligns with the intended target. The points are arrange das follows, 2 is a little left (-30 deg), 3 is a little right (30 deg), 4 is a lot left (-60 deg), 5 is a lot right (60 deg), 6 is way left (-90 deg), 7 is way right (90 deg), 8 is not quite sure how you got that far left (-120 deg), 9 is not quite sure how you got that far right (120 deg), 10 is how the hell did you get that far left? (-150 deg), 11 is How the hell did you get that far right? (150 deg), 12 is now that's bloody impossible (180 deg).

### Dodge, Block, Parry ###
* Defender's Rule: Dodge is to evade an attack avoiding all damage on success.
* Trade off: defender must forgo any actions including simple actions until defenders next turn.
* Target number is the sum of the attacker's roll to hit and the defender's acrobatics skill modifier.
* Block is to absorb an attack with an object other than the intended target of a given attack
* -4 to repose attack and -2 damage on success.
* Parry is to deflect an attack by exerting a complementary force to move the impact to a more favorable location
* +2 to repose attack requires an armed melee skill (Martial Arts, Sword, Shield, armed combat, etc.)

### Firearm damage modifiers ###
double damage if target is in contact with the muzzle.
