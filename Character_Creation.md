# Character Creation #
It is great to sit down to a game with well-written characters. It is even better when the character's attributes and abilities are reflected in the story they partake in. Many take pride in designing the characters they play, from the backstory to appearance, to attitude and social disposition. They create interesting characters with compelling and intriguing lives; the characters are center stage to the story the Game Master is guiding.

## Starting Points ##
Every character, whether it is the Player or NPC, has starting points. These are the points that you will spend on Oddities and Skills. In order to be ready for the game, the collection of Oddities and Skills must equal the Starting Points for your character.

There are two options for starting points:

1. The Game Master assigns a Starting Age and Type and players roll with the Starting Type rules.  
The character's Starting Points are equal to the sum of the Primary Attributes.
2. The Game Master assigns points according to the suggested minimum values (shown below).

### Starting Age and Type ###
Starting Types can be used to help add variety to the group's characters, where age and past experience is taken into account. This can help add depth and a sense of connection between characters, their past, and their place in the game world. The first step is to find out how many dice to roll. This is dictated by your age, and can be found in the Starting Age table below. 

Starting Age (in Years):

* 21+: 5d (Max points: 150)
* 16-20: 4d (Max points: 120)
* 11-15: 3d (Max points: 90)
* 6-10: 2d (Max points: 60)
* < 6: 1d (Max points: 30)

The second step is rolling your character's Primary Attributes. Primary Attribute rolls are based on the Starting Type, which is influenced by the character's age. Every starting type has its own rule for how to roll your attributes.

For rolling up characters, it is suggested that you write down each roll on a scratch piece of paper before committing it to the character sheet. Some Starting Types allow the modification of rolls before they are recorded on the character's sheet. Unless the Starting Type (or Game Master) says otherwise, the rolls will be committed to the sheet in the order they are rolled. First roll is Strength, second is Dexterity, and so on.

### Character Rank ###
Character rank is the sum of the character's Primary Attributes. When a character's points equal or exceed a given rank, the player rolls an extra set of 5d and may apply that to a chosen attribute. (This is a chance to increase an attribute, which is not guaranteed.)

* Beginner: 75 points
* Novice: 90 points
* Advanced: 105 points
* Heroic: 120 points
* Epic: 135 points
* Legendary: 150 points

*Note:* If a Game Master wants to boost characters, they can add the extra rolls as if the character had the base number of points.

## Primary Attributes ##
*CCARPS* characters have five Primary Attributes:

* **Strength** (STR): Capable of producing and/or withstanding great physical force.  

* **Dexterity** (DEX): Skill in performing tasks, especially with the hands.  

* **Constitution** (CON): A person's physique or temperament; the general health of a person.  

* **Intelligence** (INT): The faculty of thinking, judging, abstract reasoning, and conceptual understanding.  

* **Willpower** (WIL): The unwavering strength of will (intention, desire) to carry out oneâ€™s wishes.

Primary Attributes are permanent; they do not change once they have been recorded. This can be seen as a genetic limit; nothing can naturally change them. In some game worlds, magic or technology could possibly alter Primary Attributes.

## Secondary Attributes ##
The secondary attributes are average combinations of the primary attributes. Skills are based on these.

* **Charisma** (CHA): Personal charm or magnetism.  
Average of Constitution, Intelligence, and Willpower. (CON + INT + WIL) / 3  

* **Speed** (SPD): The rate of motion or action.  
Average of Strength and Dexterity. (STR + DEX) / 2  

* **Reflex** (RFX): An automatic response to a simple stimulus which does not require mental processing.  
Average of Strength, Dexterity, and Willpower. (STR + DEX + WIL) / 3  

* **Lift** (LFT): To exert the strength for raising or bearing.  
Average of Strength and Willpower. (STR + WIL) / 2  

* **Perception** (PER): Conscious understanding of something; to be aware of.  
Average of Intelligence and Willpower. (INT + WIL) / 2

## Oddities ##
These may only be taken at character creation. They are used to gain advantages and to make trade off's to provide flexibility and role-play interest in character options, or to add "character" to your characters. Your Game Master may modify a character's Oddities based on role-play events or extraordinary situations. See "List of Oddities" for the list of included Oddities.

### Wealth and Social Influence ###
Wealth and Social Influence are considered to be Oddities. All characters are required to choose their Wealth and Social Influence, and as such, these Oddities are taken at the costs outlined below. For average wealth and social influence there is no modifier and it can be taken for free. If Wealth and Social Influence are undefined at character creation they are considered to be average. 

**Wealth** is a measure of a characters accumulation of material value, including things such as property (home, car, horses), finery (cloths, tools, weapons), and currency. Ask the Game Master for currency and/or material value for starting out at a given level. The starting wealth is more a statement of the character's upbringing than the character's current status. The point gain or loss is meant to represent the character's perception of wealth and his or her ability to move in social circles. A person who was raised filthy rich would stand out like a sore thumb on skid row, just as a dirt poor person would at a country club.

* Filthy Rich: 25
* Upper Class: 15
* Middle Class: 0
* Lower Class: -15
* Dirt Poor: -25

**Social Influence** is measured by the number of people you have in your contact list, and the quality of the contact relationship eg. An Acquaintance (a low quality contact) will accept your call and listen to your request, they may even provide information if asked the right question but the information has a 50% chance of being inaccurate. A Friend (an average contact) is like a good friend, you can trust them to tell you what they know but they have limited access to high level information, and generally will not get into harms way for you. A Confidant (a high quality contact) will have good access to information and be trustworthy and reliable and will defend you at his or her own risk up to but not including risk of his or her own life.

* 1pt = Acquaintance
* 3pt = Friend
* 5pt = Confidant

## Skills ##
Skills determine what your character can do as well as what they know. Adding one point to a skill is the equivalent of the character experimenting with new ideas, or reading a basic instruction manual, or taking an introductory lesson from one who knows the skill at an advanced level (or higher). This gives the character the ability to use the skill with no special proficiency. Before a character can attempt to use a skill they must apply at least one point to it. Each point in a skill equals that skill's level. It onlly takes a single point to raise a skill to the next level.

Each skill will have an attribute associated with it. These attributes are skill requirements; at character creation, no skill may have a modifier that is higher than the associated attribute modifier, e.g. if your Intelligence modifier is +2, you cannot have your Reading skill level any higher than +2. During a campaign, this level cap does not apply unless the game world / Game Master says otherwise.

Skills come in three types: **Natural**, **Knowledge**, and **Martial**.

**Natural Skills** are the skills that can only be learned through practice and experiment. Things like walking and running are simple natural skills; climbing and belaying are examples of a difficult natural skill.

**Knowledge Skills** are skills that can be learned from a book. Such as, Particle Physics, reading, and writing.

**Martial Skills** like Karate, Archery, or wood carving must be learned from a teacher.

These learning limits only apply to the first level of the skill once a character has the basic concepts further learning can be done without the assistance of the trainer or books.

Please see "List of Skills" for the included list of skills to choose from.

Use the Skills and Attributes Modifier Table to find your skill level modifier and skill dice modifier for a given skill.

## Character Appearance ##
The appearance of a given character is mostly up to the player; however, it is a good idea to use character attributes as guidelines.

**Example:** The range of possible values is 5 to 30 for an adult aged character (over 21). Armed with this information, just as we would consider a person with an intelligence of 5 to be an imbecile, we would consider a person with a 5 in charisma to be repulsive. Therefore, it would be unusual for a perceived strong character to have a low strength.

As for the stature of a character, the following table will give the average height of characters by race, the actual height of a character can vary as much as plus or minus one foot, for example: a human could be as much as 7ft tall or as little as 5ft tall and still be considered normal.

_GM Note:_ feel free to add in any race or body type you feel would enhance your world. You are welcome to use the races listed here as templates but such consideration is not required. You are the God of your world after all.

## Character Background ##
This is pretty much open to the players creativity. Background story can go a long way toward identifying a character.s habits of mind, body, and spirit. This can aid the player in making good believable decisions and greatly enhance the role play experience as well as add to the group dynamics. So put some thought into this part, make it interesting and be creative. Prestige, Prejudice, and oddities can go a long way to help with good back story.

## Improving Your Character ##
Adventure points are earned through adventuring. As a general rule, each player earns one point for each session that they actively role-play in a given campaign. Further points can be earned by; performing an action that directly furthers the plot, rolling a critical success on a plot related action, performing an action that helps the group at great risk to self, remaining in character when there is great pressure to break down the fourth wall, etc. each of the aforementioned actions earns one point for the character. Team points can be awarded in cases where the team makes a deliberate, unprovoked effort to coordinate their actions to further the plot.

**Point assignment:** Points must be assigned at the time they are given, points cannot be stored up. At the beginning of any session where a character has unassigned points, those points must be assigned to an accumulator before play begins. Adventure points can be used to improve your character's skills.

Once points are assigned to a skill they may not be moved or re-assigned. Skills can be increased by applying points to the skill level accumulator for a desired skill. Die bonuses are applied at 6 for Novice, 18 for Advanced, and 36 for Master. Modifier bonuses are gained according to the skill modifier table. The maximum points one can apply to any skill is 36. New skills can be added to your character during play by working with a trainer or reading the appropriate book, but they must be built up through the levels by adding points to the accumulator.

**Example:** Bob the bouncer wants to add martial arts to his skill list to gain a block/parry advantage to his fighting skills. At the end of the session he has earned 3 adventure points, Bob will locate a trainer or buy a book and add the chosen skill to the list applying any or all of the 3 points he earned.
