## Encumberance ##
Player characters can carry mass equal to 10 times their Lift modifier. Every pound over the maximum adds -1 to all physical actions. When a character's encomberance modifer brings the overall action modifier below 0 that character must roll to succeed on simple actions such as walking upright, turning around, stopping quickly, etc.
