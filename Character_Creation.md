# Character Creation #
It is great to sit down to a game with well-written characters. It is even better when the character's attributes and abilities are reflected in the story they partake in. Many take pride in designing the characters they play, from the backstory to appearance, to attitude and social disposition. They create interesting characters with compelling and intriguing lives; the characters are center stage to the story the Game Master is guiding.

## Starting Points ##
Every character, whether it is the Player or NPC, has starting points. These are the points that you will spend on Oddities and Skills. In order to be ready for the game, the collection of Oddities and Skills must equal the Starting Points for your character.

### Starting Age ###
Starting Types can be used to help add variety to the group's characters, where age and past experience is taken into account. This can help add depth and a sense of connection between characters, their past, and their place in the game world. The first step is to find out how many dice to roll. This is dictated by your age, and can be found in the Starting Age table below. 

Starting Age (in Years):

* 21+: 5d (Max points: 150)
* 16-20: 4d (Max points: 120)
* 11-15: 3d (Max points: 90)
* 6-10: 2d (Max points: 60)
* < 6: 1d (Max points: 30)

The second step is rolling your character's Primary Attributes. 

For rolling up characters, it is suggested that you write down each roll on a scratch piece of paper before committing it to the character sheet. Some Starting Types allow the modification of rolls before they are recorded on the character's sheet. Unless the Starting Type (or Game Master) says otherwise, the rolls will be committed to the sheet in the order they are rolled. First roll is Strength, second is Dexterity, and so on.

### Character Rank ###
Character rank is the sum of the character's Primary Attributes. When a character's points equal or exceed a given rank, the player rolls an extra set of 5d and may apply that to a chosen attribute. (This is a chance to increase an attribute, which is not guaranteed.)

* Beginner: 75 points
* Novice: 90 points
* Advanced: 105 points
* Heroic: 120 points
* Epic: 135 points
* Legendary: 150 points

*Note:* If a Game Master wants to boost characters, they can add the extra rolls as if the character had the base number of points.

## Primary Attributes ##
*CCARPS* characters have five Primary Attributes:

* **Strength** (STR): Capable of producing and/or withstanding great physical force.  

* **Dexterity** (DEX): Skill in performing tasks, especially with the hands.  

* **Constitution** (CON): A person's physique or temperament; the general health of a person.  

* **Intelligence** (INT): The faculty of thinking, judging, abstract reasoning, and conceptual understanding.  

* **Willpower** (WIL): The unwavering strength of will (intention, desire) to carry out oneâ€™s wishes.

Primary Attributes are permanent; they do not change once they have been recorded. This can be seen as a genetic limit; nothing can naturally change them. In some game worlds, magic or technology could possibly alter Primary Attributes.

## Secondary Attributes ##
The secondary attributes are average combinations of the primary attributes. Skills are based on these.

* **Charisma** (CHA): Personal charm or magnetism.  
Average of Constitution, Intelligence, and Willpower. (CON + INT + WIL) / 3  

* **Speed** (SPD): The rate of motion or action.  
Average of Strength and Dexterity. (STR + DEX) / 2  

* **Reflex** (RFX): An automatic response to a simple stimulus which does not require mental processing.  
Average of Strength, Dexterity, and Willpower. (STR + DEX + WIL) / 3  

* **Lift** (LFT): To exert the strength for raising or bearing.  
Average of Strength and Willpower. (STR + WIL) / 2  

* **Perception** (PER): Conscious understanding of something; to be aware of.  
Average of Intelligence and Willpower. (INT + WIL) / 2

## Oddities ##
These may only be taken at character creation. They are used to gain advantages and to make trade off's to provide flexibility and role-play interest in character options, or to add "character" to your characters. Your Game Master may modify a character's Oddities based on role-play events or extraordinary situations. Oddities may make permanent Health changes based on its logical description (or Game Master's discretion). The base Oddities follow the *Disposition System*, which outlines six major points of Disposition. The *Disposition System* is not exclusive to characters and can be used to characterize any group of people (cities, countries, kingdoms, non-profit organizations, etc.).

The general rule with Oddities is that each Oddity must have a cost to its benefit.

### Character Creation-specific Oddities ###
During character creation, there are two Oddities that are required unless the Game Master specifies otherwise. These are **Wealth** and **Social Influence**. There are no Modifiers with these; instead, they help give characters some "roots" into the game world. If no *Wealth* or *Social Influence* is taken, it is assumed they are Middle Class with no special contacts.

**Wealth** is a measure of a characters accumulation of material value, including things such as property (home, car, horses), finery (cloths, tools, weapons), and currency. The points spent or given are meant to represent the character's perception of wealth and their ability to move in social circles. A person raised with a filthy rich lifestyle would stand out like a sore thumb on skid row, just as a dirt poor person would at a country club.

* -25 points: Dirt Poor
* -15 points: Lower Class
* 0 points: Middle Class
* 15 points: Upper Class
* 25 points: Filthy Rich

**Social Influence** is measured by the number of people you have in your contact list, and the quality of the contact relationship eg. An Acquaintance (a low quality contact) will accept your call and listen to your request, they may even provide information if asked the right question but the information has a 50% chance of being inaccurate. A Friend (an average contact) is like a good friend, you can trust them to tell you what they know but they have limited access to high level information, and generally will not get into harms way for you. A Confidant (a high quality contact) will have good access to information and be trustworthy and reliable and will defend you at his or her own risk up to but not including risk of his or her own life. By default, you can only take *three* contacts and you cannot spend or receive more than 15 points.

* -15 points: Arch-nemesis
* -10 points: Nemesis
* -5 points: Antagonist
* 0 points: No-one out of the ordinary.
* 5 points: Acquaintance
* 10 points: Friend
* 15 points: Confidant

## Skills ##
Skills determine what your character can do as well as what they know. Adding one point to a skill is the equivalent of the character experimenting with new ideas, or reading a basic instruction manual, or taking an introductory lesson from one who knows the skill at an advanced level (or higher). This gives the character the ability to use the skill with no special proficiency (and without a super low Target Number). 

Before a character can attempt to use a skill they must apply at least one point to it for it to be useful. Trying to use a skill without any proficiency has a base Target Number of 0 plus the Modifier of the ruling Attribute. This makes it possible to attempt a an unskilled action in non-stressful situations. It becomes near impossible when under stress, such as during combat or while moderately injured.

Each skill will have an Attribute associated with it. These attributes are skill requirements; no skill may have a modifier that is higher than the associated attribute modifier. For example, if your Charisma Modifier is +2, you cannot have your Reading skill modifier any higher than +2.

## Character Appearance ##
The appearance of a given character is generally up to the player. However, it is a good idea to use character Attributes, Oddities, and Skills as guidelines. The range of possible values in a base Attribute is 5 to 30 for an adult character (21 years or older). Just as a person with an Intelligence of 5 would be seen as an imbecile, a person with 5 in Charisma would be a rather unlikeable fellow. It would be unusual for a perceived strong character to have low Strength. It should be noted that CCARPS characters range the average Human height: between 4' 6" to 7". Any other heights are up to the Game Master.

## Character Background ##
This is pretty much open to player creativity. Background story can go a long way toward identifying a character's habits of mind, body, and spirit. This can aid the player in making good believable decisions and greatly enhance the role play experience as well as add to the group dynamics. So put some thought into this part, make it interesting and be creative. The character's *Disposition* is a great thing to keep in mind when writing their story.

## Improving Your Character ##
Points are earned through adventuring. As a general rule, each player should earn between 10-15 points per session that they actively roleplay. More points can be earned by: performing an action that directly furthers the plot; rolling a *Critical Success* on a plot-related action; performing an action that helps the group at great rist to self; remaining in character when there is a great pressure to break the fourth wall, etc. It is up to the Game Master, how many points each character receives, and when. Character teams that work together to deliberately coordinate their actions to further the plot (without having hints given by the Game Master) generally obtain more points than ones that are always squabbling.

**Point assignment:** Points must be assigned within the session they are given; points cannot be stored up. At the beginning of any session where a character has unassigned points, those points must be assigned to a Skill or into an Attribute accumulator before play begins.

Once points are assigned to a skill they may not be moved or re-assigned. Skills are increased by adding points to them. Modifier bonuses are gained according to the Modifier Table (see *Modifier Table* above). The maximum points a Skill can have is 36. New Skills can be learned through a trainer, reading the appropriate book, or similar learning adventures. Even when learning a new Skill this way, one must use the points given during that session. For example:

*Bob the Bouncer wants to add a combat skill to gain a block/parry advantage for when he has to confront unruly people. At the end of the session, Bob has earned 3 points; he either locates a trainer or self-teaches by reading a book. He applies all three points he's earned to the new Skill.*
