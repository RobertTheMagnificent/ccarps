# Community Codex Adaptive RolePlay System #
CCARPS rule system by WizardSpire Games.

## What is it? ##
CCARPS, formally known as Community Codex Adaptive RolePlay System, is an open source and Creative Commons-licensed roleplay system. This system has been developed because we wanted to build games that can have a reusable and easy to understand framework, without the licensing restrictions of others.

We chose to go the Creative Commons route because we believe strongly that a closed copyright would hinder creativity for anyone that wants to use CCARPS. We are a group that has been part of open source communities and have found great inspiration in their collective and creative efforts.

Roleplaying is a community event. So should the rulemaking be.
