# Combat #
The act of combat is represented as a series of skill tests. The attacker makes a success test against the related skill or attribute plus any attack modifiers. On success, the attacker stages up the damage using all applicable damage modifiers from skills, PPO, and weapon enchantments. Finally, the defender gets an opportunity to block, dodge, or parry the attack by making a success test against his or her reflex, plus any related skill modifiers, plus any defensive modifiers from armor and stages the damage down using the resulting value.

## Combat Sequence ##
**Step 1:** Attacker rolls against the base target number, plus any skill modifiers, plus any weapon attack modifiers.

**Step 2:** On success, attacker sums the total modifiers from weapon damage modifiers, skill damage modifiers, and PPO damage modifiers and reports the final damage stage to the defender.

**Step 3:** The defender makes a success test against the attacker's roll plus their chosen defensive skill modifier.

**Step 4:** The difference between the roll and the target number plus any armor bonuses is used to reduce the damage level of the attack. 

**Step 5:** Record the damage by marking each consecutive damage box starting at the lowest available box in the related damage type. If damage is reduced below one then no damage is recorded.

## Melee Example ##
**Set up** A character, having a hand-to-hand combat skill at level 6 (first novice level), wants to punch another character. The defender has an opportunity to react with a block, dodge, or parry depending on the choice of available defense skills. The attacker's target number to succeed in hitting the opponent is 6 for a moderately difficult task, plus the skill modifier for the attack skill used, plus any attack modifiers on the weapon used. In this case the base target number is 6, level modifier is 3, and weapon modifier 0 (brass knuckles have no modifier to attack), Final Target# = 6 + 3 + 0 = 9

**Step E1** The attacking player rolls 3d6 with values 2, 3, and 6 then he or she sums the two lowest values (2 and 3) to get his or her chance of success (5). In this case the attack succeeds because the attack success of 5 is lower than the target number of 6. 

**Step E2** The attacker stages up the damage. Brass knuckle's have damage index of [STR]+1M. Our attacker has a strength modifier of 4, and a skill modifier of 3, Sum all the values: 4+1+3 = 8. Use the total to stage the damage up.

**Step E3** The defender, in this case, has enhanced reflexs providing a modifier of +1 and has a hand to hand skill at level 4 which gives him a modifier of +2 to parry. The defender's target number is the sum of the attacker's roll 5 plus reflex modifier 2 plus parry modifier 2 for a total of 9. The defender rolls two dice (see skill modifier table) based on her hand to hand skill and gets a 3 and a 4 then adds the two dice for a total of 7. Since 7 is less than 9 the parry is successful. 

**Step E4** The defender subtracts the result from the target number (9 - 7 = 2) and adds her armor's damage resistance modifier of +2 against bludgeoning from her type II body armor, and  then uses the remaining points to stage the damage down. In this case the defender will use 4 points to stage the damage down.

**Step E5** Apply the damage to the appropriate damage meterDamage of 8 minus defence of 4 = 4 damage. The damage type is determined by the weapon, in this case a fist does Mental damage (All blunt force damage will first register on the Mental meter)

**Note** Critical rolls do not apply to damage rolls, If the attack roll was a critical success the final damage staging number is doubled. 

**Note** When a player chooses to attack there are two options: General target, and Called shot. General target is an attack at a chosen target. A Called shot is an attack at a specific location or region of a chosen target.
 
# Hit Location Chart #
When a player designates a target and launches a projectile, the player must roll below the modified target number in order to hit. if the player rolls above the target number the projectile completely misses.

**Shot from the Hip** In the case of a hit w/o a called shot, the gm rolls two hit dice (2D6) to determine where the projectile hits the target. the values, for a humanoid target, of each area of the body are as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
roll	| Area of impact
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2	| Head
3-4	| Chest / Upper back (lungs, heart, liver, etc.)
5-7	| Abdomen / Lower back (belly, pelvis, kidneys, etc.)
8-9	| Leg (closest to attacker / most reasonable of the two)
10-11	| Arm (closest to attacker / most reasonable of the two)
12	| Neck, buttocks/ass, groin (most reasonable for the situation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Called Shot Miss**
when a player designates an area to hit on a target the player must roll below the modified target number to hit. if the player's roll is equal to or greater than the modified target number the players shot will miss. As you may have guessed, this is where Sir Issaic's first law comes in, an object in motion tends to stay in motion, etc. etc. so that thing; fist, arrow, bullet must go somewhere. The following chart and 1D6 will help you figure out what force will cancel the motion of the object. Imagine a circle cut into 6 slices (see image below) overlaid on the target with its center point on the called location. Now roll 1D6 and count the pie slices clockwise from the top to determine which direction the miss took. If it please you use the difference between the modified target number and the players roll to determine the magnatude in whatever units seem appropriate for the situation. Then let Sir Issaic prove his stuff by knocking the F out of the projectile and and into the unintended location; Newton's second law is the relationship Force equals mass times acceleration ( F = ma ). you can use your imagination for Newton's third law, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Ring of Fail**
In the case of the epic fail, all dice come up 6, we have a Ring of fail. To use the ring of fail orient the 12 segmented circle such that the number 1 position aligns with the intended target. the points are arainged as follows, 2 is a little left (-30 deg), 3 is a little right (30 deg), 4 is a lot left (-60 deg), 5 is a lot right (60 deg), 6 is way left (-90 deg), 7 is way right (90 deg), 8 is not quite sure how you got that far left (-120 deg), 9 is not quite sure how you got that far right (120 deg), 10 is how the hell did you get that far left? (-150 deg), 11 is How the hell did you get that far right? (150 deg), 12 is now that's bloody impossible (180 deg).
