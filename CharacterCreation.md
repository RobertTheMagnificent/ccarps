# Character Creation #
It is great to sit down to a game with well written characters and even better when the characters attributes are reflected in the story told about them. Many roleplayers take great pride in designing the characters they play, from the back story to the description of appearance to the attitude and social disposition, they create interesting characters with compelling and intriguing lives. To assist in making those connections between attributes and storyline we have organized the character creation section to take you from the basic details to the final story in that order such that you can incorporate the most important facts about your character from the very beginning. With that said please feel free to explore your character from the ground up beginning with his or her primary attributes.

## Starting Points ##
There are two options for starting points:

**Option A**, GM assigns points according to the suggested minimum values below. (This option homogenizes the group and allows for quicker character creation)  
**Option B**, Players roll dice to determine the starting points. (I find that this method creates more diversity within the group but it will take longer to roll up characters. Use this option when the group has plenty of time to get started. This option works better when the adventure is in progress and a character has died, the player can take all the time he or she needs to build the replacement character.)

* **Beginner:** roll five sets of d6 according to the age specific table below.(Average See Table)
* **Novice:** must be over 18 yrs of age; roll five sets of d6 re-roll all ones (Average of 80 points).
* **Advanced:** must be over 21 yrs of age; roll six sets of d6 according to the age specific table (Average of 90 points).
* **Heroic:** must be over 21 yrs of age; roll six sets of 5d6 re-roll all ones (Average of 100 points).
* **Epic:** must be over 21 yrs of age; roll eight sets of 5d6 (Average of 130 points ).
* **Legendary:** must be over 21 yrs of age; roll ten sets of 5d6 (Average of 150 points).

Age in Years and number of d6 per set:

* 21+: 5d6 (Average: 75pts)
* 16-20: 4d6 (Average: 60pts)
* 11-15: 3d6 (Average: 45pts)
* 6-10: 2d6 (Average: 30pts)
* < 6: 1d6 (Average: 15pts)

## Primary Attributes ##
The primary attributes are based on a Human character. For other races like Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Troll, and Gnome, we will use die modifiers to enhance and detract from the base attributes (see racial modifier table). The number of dice you should roll will be determined by the GM and the difficulty level of the world he or she has created.

There are five primary attributes:

* STR  = Strength
* DEX  = Dexterity
* CON  = Constitution
* INT  = Intelligence / IQ
* WILL = Willpower

Once the primary attributes are assigned, they cannot be changed. Think of them as genetic limits. That is not to say that technology and magical items cannot be used to change them.

* Roll 1 = STR
* Roll 2 = DEX
* Roll 3 = CON
* Roll 4 = INT
* Roll 5 = WILL

### Character Points ###
At character creation initial character points are equal to the sum total of your character's primary attributes Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, and Willpower. The initial character points are used to buy Oddities, Prestige, Prejudice, and starting Skills.

## Secondary Attributes ##
The secondary attributes are average combinations of the primary attributes. Skills are based on these.

* Charisma = avg(C,I,W); (CON + INT + WILL) / 3
* Speed = avg(S,D); (STR + DEX) / 2
* Reflex = avg(S,D,W); (STR + DEX + WILL) / 3
* Lift = avg(S,W); (STR + WILL) / 2
* Perception = avg(I,W); (INT + WILL) / 2

## Prestige, Prejudice, and Oddities ##
These may only be taken at character creation. They are used to gain advantages and to make trade off's to provide flexibility and role-play interest in character options, or to add "character" to your characters. Your game master may modify a character's Prestige, Prejudice, or Oddity based on role-play events or extraordinary situations.

**Prestige** will give positive effects to your roll such as reducing your die rolls in success tests or adding modifier dice.

**Prejudice** will bring negative effects to your character and therefore cost negative points to acquire, by taking a prejudice you can add points to your total to be spent on Prestige, oddities, or skills.

**Oddities** are just that, they can enhance your character in some situations and detract from it in others. Generally they are less noticeable than Prestige and Prejudice, but serve to create similar effects.

### Wealth and Influence ###
Wealth and Influence are considered to be Prestige, or Prejudice depending on the extreme to which your character is subject. All characters are required to choose their Wealth and Influence. For average wealth and influence there is no modifier and it can be taken for free. If Wealth and Influence are undefined at character creation they are considered to be average. 

**Wealth** is a measure of a characters accumulation of material value, including things such as property (home, car, horses), finery (cloths, tools, weapons), and currency. Ask the Game Master for currency and/or material value for starting out at a given level. The starting wealth is more a statement of the character's upbringing than the character's current status. The point gain or loss is meant to represent the character's perception of wealth and his or her ability to move in social circles. A person who was raised filthy rich would stand out like a sore thumb on skid row, just as a dirt poor person would at a country club.

* Filthy Rich: 25
* Upper Class: 15
* Middle Class: 0
* Lower Class: -15
* Dirt Poor: -25

**Influence** is measured by the number of people you have in your contact list, and the quality of the contact relationship eg. An Acquaintance (a low quality contact) will accept your call and listen to your request, they may even provide information if asked the right question but the information has a 50% chance of being inaccurate. A Friend (an average contact) is like a good friend, you can trust them to tell you what they know but they have limited access to high level information, and generally will not get into harms way for you. A Confidant (a high quality contact) will have good access to information and be trustworthy and reliable and will defend you at his or her own risk up to but not including risk of his or her own life. Each character starts with a number of contacts. Contacts are purchased with contact points that are awarded based on the level of Wealth and Influence assigned to the character.

* 1pt = Acquaintance
* 2pt = Friend
* 3pt = Confidant)

## Skills ##
Skills determine what your character can do as well as what they know. Adding one point to a skill is the equivalent of the character experimenting with new ideas, or reading a basic instruction manual, or taking an introductory lesson from one who knows the skill at an advanced level (or higher). This gives the character the ability to use the skill with no special proficiency. Before a character can attempt to use a skill they must apply at least one point to it. Each point in a skill equals that skill's level. It onlly takes a single point to raise a skill to the next level.

Each skill will have an attribute associated with it. These attributes are skill requirements; no skill may have a modifier that is higher than the associated attribute modifier, e.g. if your Intelligence modifier is +2, you cannot have your Reading skill modifier any higher than +2. During a campaign, this level cap does not apply unless the game world / Game Master says otherwise.

Skills come in three types: **Natural**, **Knowledge**, and **Martial**.

**Natural Skills** are the skills that can only be learned through practice and experiment. Things like walking and running are simple natural skills, Wild Magic is an example of a difficult natural skill.

**Knowledge Skills** are skills that can be learned from a book. Such as, Particle Physics, reading, and writing.

**Martial Skills** like Karate, Archery, or wood carving must be learned from a teacher.

These learning limits only apply to the first level of the skill once a character has the basic concepts further learning can be done without the assistance of the trainer or books.

Use the Skills and Attributes Modifier Table to find your skill level modifier and skill dice modifier for a given skill.  
*TODO: Create nice image table for this.*

## Character Appearance ##
The appearance of a given character is mostly up to the player; however, it is a good idea to use character attributes as guidelines.

**Example:** The range of possible values is 5 to 30 for an adult aged character (over 21). Armed with this information, just as we would consider a person with an intelligence of 5 to be an imbecile, we would consider a person with a 5 in charisma to be repulsive. Therefore, it would be unusual for a perceived strong character to have a low strength.

As for the stature of a character, the following table will give the average height of characters by race, the actual height of a character can vary as much as plus or minus one foot, for example: a human could be as much as 7ft tall or as little as 5ft tall and still be considered normal.

_GM Note:_ feel free to add in any race or body type you feel would enhance your world. You are welcome to use the races listed here as templates but such consideration is not required. You are the God of your world after all.

## Character Background ##
This is pretty much open to the players creativity. Background story can go a long way toward identifying a character.s habits of mind, body, and spirit. This can aid the player in making good believable decisions and greatly enhance the role play experience as well as add to the group dynamics. So put some thought into this part, make it interesting and be creative. Prestige, Prejudice, and oddities can go a long way to help with good back story.

## Improving Your Character ##
Adventure points are earned through adventuring. As a general rule, each player earns one point for each session that they actively role-play in a given campaign. Further points can be earned by; performing an action that directly furthers the plot, rolling a critical success on a plot related action, performing an action that helps the group at great risk to self, remaining in character when there is great pressure to break down the fourth wall, etc. each of the aforementioned actions earns one point for the character. Team points can be awarded in cases where the team makes a deliberate, unprovoked effort to coordinate their actions to further the plot.

**Point assignment:** Points must be assigned at the time they are given, points cannot be stored up. At the beginning of any session where a character has unassigned points, those points must be assigned to an accumulator before play begins. Adventure points can be used to improve your character's skills.

Once points are assigned to a skill they may not be moved or re-assigned. Skills can be increased by applying points to the skill level accumulator for a desired skill. Die bonuses are applied at 6 for Novice, 18 for Advanced, and 36 for Master. Modifier bonuses are gained according to the skill modifier table. The maximum points one can apply to any skill is 36. New skills can be added to your character during play by working with a trainer or reading the appropriate book, but they must be built up through the levels by adding points to the accumulator.

**Example:** Bob the bouncer wants to add martial arts to his skill list to gain a block/parry advantage to his fighting skills. At the end of the session he has earned 3 adventure points, Bob will locate a trainer or buy a book and add the chosen skill to the list applying any or all of the 3 points he earned.
