# Combat #
The act of combat is represented as a series of skill tests. The attacker makes a success test against the related skill or attribute plus any attack modifiers. On success, the attacker stages up the damage using all applicable damage modifiers from skills, PPO, and weapon enchantments. Finally, the defender gets an opportunity to block, dodge, or parry the attack by making a success test against his or her reflex, plus any related skill modifiers, plus any defensive modifiers from armor and stages the damage down using the resulting value.

## Combat Sequence ##
**Step 1:** Attacker rolls against the base target number, plus any skill modifiers, plus any weapon attack modifiers.
**Step 2:** On success, attacker sums the total modifiers from weapon damage modifiers, skill damage modifiers, and PPO damage modifiers and reports the final damage stage to the defender.
**Step 3:** The defender makes a success test against the attacker's roll plus their chosen defensive skill modifier.
**Step 4:** The difference between the roll and the target number plus any armor bonuses is used to reduce the damage level of the attack. 
**Step 5:** Record the damage by marking each consecutive damage box starting at the lowest available box in the related damage type. If damage is reduced below one then no damage is recorded.

## Melee Example ##
**Set up** A character, having a hand-to-hand combat skill at level 6 (first novice level), wants to punch another character. The defender has an opportunity to react with a block, dodge, or parry depending on the choice of available defense skills. The attacker's target number to succeed in hitting the opponent is 6 for a moderately difficult task, plus the skill modifier for the attack skill used, plus any attack modifiers on the weapon used. In this case the base target number is 6, level modifier is 3, and weapon modifier 0 (brass knuckles have no modifier to attack), Final Target# = 6 + 3 + 0 = 9

**Step E1**The attacking player rolls 3d6 with values 2, 3, and 6 then he or she sums the two lowest values (2 and 3) to get his or her chance of success (5). In this case the attack succeeds because the attack success of 5 is lower than the target number of 6. 

**Step E2**The attacker stages up the damage. Brass knuckle's have damage index of [STR]+1M. Our attacker has a strength modifier of 4, and a skill modifier of 3, Sum all the values: 4+1+3 = 8. Use the total to stage the damage up.

**Step E3**The defender, in this case, has enhanced reflexs providing a modifier of +1 and has a hand to hand skill at level 4 which gives him a modifier of +2 to parry. The defender's target number is the sum of the attacker's roll 5 plus reflex modifier 2 plus parry modifier 2 for a total of 9. The defender rolls two dice (see skill modifier table) based on her hand to hand skill and gets a 3 and a 4 then adds the two dice for a total of 7. Since 7 is less than 9 the parry is successful. 

**Step E4** The defender subtracts the result from the target number (9 - 7 = 2) and adds her armor's damage resistance modifier of +2 against bludgeoning from her type II body armor, and  then uses the remaining points to stage the damage down. In this case the defender will use 4 points to stage the damage down.

**Step E5** Apply the damage to the appropriate damage meterDamage of 8 minus defence of 4 = 4 damage. The damage type is determined by the weapon, in this case a fist does Mental damage (All blunt force damage will first register on the Mental meter)
**Note** Critical rolls do not apply to damage rolls, If the attack roll was a critical success the final damage staging number is doubled.
