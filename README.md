# Community Codex Adaptive Role Play System #

## What is it? ##
CCARPS is an open source, Creative Commons-licensed roleplay system that is legal to be included in commercial works, provided you credit the authors, WizardSpire Games.

## Philosophy ##
It is our belief that role playing systems should be free from restriction in use and manner of play. Role playing is a community event that requires community action so it is our intention to create, collect, and maintain the rules in a fashion consistent with the needs and desires of the community that uses it.

The goal for the Community Codex Adaptive Role Play System is to provide an open framework for building role-playing games. As such, the rules here will be rather sparse. It is a framework in which you can build your own system, to cater to the style of game you want to play. The key difference between CCARPS and other role play systems is the license. Our intent is to create a role play system that is owned and maintained by the community that uses it. Therefore, we want you to understand that any contributions made to the system will become the property of the community. We expect citizens of the CCARPS community to conduct themselves in a respectful manner.
