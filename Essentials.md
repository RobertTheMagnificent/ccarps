# What is *CCARPS*? #
The Community Codex Adaptive RolePlay System, often referred to as its acronym, "*CCARPS*", is an open source and Creative Commons-licensed ruleset. This system has been developed to promote storytelling over rulemongering; we think that the game should be about the characters, so the rules shouldn't get in the way. This is a Community Codex; players and developers alike can actively participate in the shaping and refinement of this rule system. It is adaptive; the base rules are meant to be a generic starting point so as to allow any style of gameplay and world. While the main goal is roleplay, the system is built in a character-centric way so that it can power any type of gameplay that involves tracking player statistics.

# The Essentials #
*CCARPS* exclusively uses six-sided dice. Dice rolls are indicated by appending a "d" after the number of dice; "4d" means "four dice." Each player will utilize between two and five dice in an attempt to roll as low as possible. The goal is to roll lower than the assigned Target Number. A Target Number is the base difficulty for performing an action. Modifiers do not affect any dice rolls. Weapon, armor, and skill modifiers increase or reduce the Target Number.

## Modifiers ##
All attributes and skills have Modifiers, as will some equipment and Oddities. These Modifiers are used to alter a given base *Target Number*. Your character Modifiers *add* to the Target Number. If it is a contested roll, the opposing side's Modifiers *reduce* the Target Number. The higher you can make your Target Number, the more likely you will succeed.

## Rolling for Success ##
There is only one "dice roll mechanic" in *CCARPS*: a base *Target Number* is assigned, modifiers are applied to the base *Target Number*, and dice are rolled in an attempt to roll *lower than* the Target Number. This is achieved by using the two *lowest* dice in any dice roll set. This applies to all rolls, including the Game Master, NPCs, and creatures.

*You are sneaking around in a dark and unfamiliar place. You have a "Stealth" skill with a modifier of 1 and quiet shoes with a Modifier of 2. The base Target Number to successfully be undetected is a 3. You add your modifier to the Target Number (3 + 1 + 2); you must roll under a 6. You roll 2d; it's a 5. You are successfully stealthy.*

*Someone walks nearby, which contests your active "Stealth" skill. You stop moving, so your base Target Number is 8. The person has a "Detect" skill modifier of 2, which brings your Target Number down to 6. Adding your "Stealth" modifier of 1, your Target Number is 7. Rolling 2d, you see, to your horror, a 5 and a 6. At a total of 11, you have failed to stay stealthy. You bumped a vase, so the person asks "Who's there?" and begins walking guardedly toward your position.*

*CCARPS* has three types of Target Number modification:

* Basic Target Number: Target Number, no modifications.
* Skill Target Number: Target Number + your applicable Modifiers
* Contested Target Number: Target Number + your applicable Modifiers - opposing Modifiers

## Critical Success, Critical Failure ##
A *Critical Success* happens when *all* dice in a roll set are 1. The more dice you roll, the more often you will succeed, but the harder it is to get a *Critical Success*. A *Critical Success* means the action succeeds and has a *better than expected* result. The more dice in a set, the more amazing a critical will be.

Conversely, a *Critical Failure* happens when *all* dice in a roll set are 6. It becomes harder to critically fail when you roll more dice. A *Critical Failure* has *worse than expected* results. The more dice in a rolled set, the harsher the *Critical Fail* will be.

## Automatic Success ##
There are a lot of actions that characters will take that are trivial or common sense. These do not require a roll and are counted as autmatically succeeding. The only time these will need a roll are when there are adverse conditions (weather, battle, impeding injury, etc.) or when the Game Master says. Going from your home to store requires no roll; pushing a mugger away will.
