# The Dice #
CCARPS is a d6 system that utilizes five six-sided dice throughout the game. A player rolls a number of dice between two and five in an attempt to roll the lowest possible score. Success tests are based on the two lowest dice in any given roll. Success rolls are required for Perception checks, Combat actions (Attack, Parry, Block, and Dodge), Skill tests, and Attribute tests. Like most games, there are critical success and failure rolls. A critical success is any roll where all the dice roll 1; critical failure is any roll where all the dice roll 6.
