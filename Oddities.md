# Oddities #
Oddities are meant to add flavour to the characters in a group they are minor versions of the Prestige and Prejudices A character can take up to five oddities at a cost of -1 for each. For example Greed is a prejudice insisting on being paid in silver is an oddity. You may also buy off an oddity by paying 1 character point, but you really shouldnâ€™t do that. Watch that you roleplay any oddities you take because the GM will be looking for them and may penalize you for not role playing them.
