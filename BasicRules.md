# Basic Rules #
CCARPS is a d6 system that utilizes five six-sided dice throughout the game. A player rolls a number of dice between two and five in an attempt to roll the lowest possible score. Success tests are based on the two lowest dice in any given roll. Success rolls are required for Perception checks, Combat actions ( Attack, Parry, Block, and Dodge), Skill tests, and Attribute tests.

## Critical Rolls ##
Critical success is any roll where all the dice roll a 1, a critical failure is any roll where all the dice roll a 6. On any critical roll a player character will draw a chance card. Chance cards apply advantages and disadvantages to the character and the world depending on whether the player rolled a success or a failure.
