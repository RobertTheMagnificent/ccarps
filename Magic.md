# Magic #
There are three types of magic; _Arcane_, _Spiritual_, and _Wild_.
Casting magic requires a character to channel energy through their self in order to reform the energy into a new pattern. The act of casting magic causes the magic user some serious although temporary discomfort in the form of mental damage known as energy drain. When casting the magic user can chose a casting level from 1 to the value of his or her chosen magic skill modifier. After casting no matter the level of success the magic user will take drain equal to the chosen casting level and check off one box from their damage meter, starting with mental, for each level . (casting at level 3 will cause 3 drain. in the case of a critical success divide the drain in half rounded down (3 / 2 = 1.5 = 1.) On a critical failure double the drain amount (3 * 2 = 6.)

Players can summon spirits and/or work together through a single foci to cast magic beyond level 8 in this case the magic users will each take an equal share of the drain caused by the spell. In all cases foci and spirit channeling can be used to reduce the drain.The maximum casting level is the sum of all the magic user's casting skill modifiers in the casting group. The target numbers are based on the charts below (they vary from type to type.) then modified by subtracting the casting level from the base target number.

## Drain ##
Magical drain for all types of magic is simply the casting level. If you cast a fireball at level 3, you would take 3 points of Mental damage. This can be mitigated by use of foci, which are dependent on your type of magic. A critical success cuts your drain in half, rounded down.

Remember that the standard Laws of Magic apply to all magic types:
* Energy cannot be created nor destroyed it can only be transformed.
* A magic user can never believe something out of existence. In the best case, an attempt to do so will fail; in the worst case, the magic user will cause a catastrophic implosion at his location and will be atomized. 
 
## Arcane Magic (INT)##
Arcane magic is magic that manipulates the world and its energy around you, converting the energy into different forms. Arcane magic is generally taught through rigorous studies. Knife is a required skill for arcane magic, along with reading and writing in the magical languages. A silver knife often called an athame, or ceremonial dagger, is required in order to cast many spells, and is required for gathering certain spell catalysts and components, as well as being the focus-point for many spells.

The base attributes used for Arcane magic are Intelligence and Constitution (Intelligence is the Primary Attribute). Arcane magic has three basic skill prerequisites: Reading and Writing directly influence how well you can learn magic; your Knife skill influences the strength of your spell components and catalysts.

Arcane Magic has four degrees of difficulty:

* Easy (base target number = 8)
* Medium (base target number = 4)
* Hard (base target number = 0)
* Extreme (base target number = -4)

Arcane Magic Spells consist of three parts:

* Focus: A spoken incantation to concentrate or focus the thoughts on the spell.
* Conversion: A ritual to convert the catalyst or components to magical energy.
* Channel: A physical action to channel magical energy through the body to the target.

Arcane magic has five domains:

* **Life:** Anything natural occurring on land; plants, animals, insects, persons, etc.
* **Sea:** Anything natural occurring in large bodies of water; plants, animals, insects, persons, etc.
* **Sky:** Anything natural occurring in the open skies; animals, clouds, wind, etc.
* **Land:** The manipulation of the natural ground that is walked upon; sand, dirt, rocks, etc.
* **Death:** Anything that causes death or undeath; disease, walking dead, parasites, etc.

## Spiritual Magic (WILL) ##
Spiritual magic is magic that manipulates a different form or plane of energy to the users will. Spiritual magic is only taught by those who know it. The base attributes used for Spiritual magic are Will and Constitution (Will is the primary attribute). Spiritual magic has a base Knowledge Skill that is required to be known before the user can even try the following Spiritual Skills. After learning this Knowledge Skill, one may not learn any of the Spiritual Skills past the level equivalent to the Knowledge Skill.

Using Spiritual magic skills is split into four difficulties that have different base target numbers to roll against.

* Easy (base target number = 9)
* Medium (base target number = 6)
* Hard (base target number = 3)
* Extreme (base target number = 0)

## Wild Magic (CHA)##
Wild magic is the type of magic that is spontaneous in nature. Some creatures are born with an innate ability to tap into the magic around them without any formal training. These beings have a way of feeling or sensing magical things and can channel magical energies. Don't ask them how they do it or where they learned it, they'll say that they just do things and stuff happens.

The base attribute for wild magic is Charisma. As previously stated, there is no formal training available for wild magic. That means that in essence any character with a Charisma modifier above 0 can try to use wild magic. For a character to be able to perform wild magic the character must believe that it will work. However, there are no spells to learn so the character will need to imagine what they want to happen and believe it into existence. That means that on the first attempt the character must succeed or that character will have doubt and will never be able to channel magical energies. How the spell works is under GM control the player must describe the intended outcome and the GM will interpret the meaning and effect of the magic to the best of his or her abilities as it pertains to the situation.

Target numbers begin at 2 and decrease very sharply as the difficulty of an action increases (see Wild Magic chart). A critical success will always work exactly as the character envisioned it. When a character makes the first attempt add the skill Wild Magic to the character sheet if the attempt is a success set wild magic at level one and treat is just like any other skill, if the character fails set wild magic level to none that character will never be able to advance the level of the wild magic skill. On the first attempt a character will roll two dice against the target number plus the characters Charisma modifier. If successful, every roll after that will be made against the target number plus Charisma modifier plus skill modifier.

* Simple (base target number = 2)
* Easy: (base target number = 0)
* Moderate: (base target number = -2)
* Hard: (base target number = -4)
* Extreme: (base target number = -6)
* Inconceivable: (base target number = -8)

## Spells ##
There are no set spells or abilities for Wild Magic, as it is unique to each creature. However, all three types of magic are comprised of a mixture of the following.

The core of arcane magic is the manipulation and conversion of energies. When stripped down to its core, many spells are just aspects of the following general aspects.

**Attack**: Use an element of your domain to create a projectile.
Examples-
* Arcane: Fireball, Gust of Wind, Ice Needles
* Spiritual: Spirit Blast

**Defense**: Use an element of your domain to create a protective barrier in front of you.
Examples-
* Arcane: Elemental Wall, Dome of Bones
* Spiritual: Spirit Wall, Energy Dome

**Movement**: Cause movement using an element of your domain.
Examples-
* Arcane: Earthquake, tsunami (Earth element under water OR Water element moving mass of water)
* Spiritual: Spirit Push, Astral Projection

**Dissipation**: Nullify existing magic or event by forcing energy to spread apart
Examples-
* Arcane: Disperse Element, Disintegrate (Decay), Explode (Rapid Expansion), Implode (Demolish)
* Spiritual: Diffuse Spirit, Spirit Bomb (through force or expansion)

**Infusion**: Infuse target with an element of your domain.
Examples-
* Arcane: Heal, Zombify, Raise Dead, Infectious Disease, Invasive Parasites
* Spiritual: Gather Energy, Energy Feedback, Spiritual Cleansing

**Elemental Transfiguration**: Alter the outward appearance of something (mass stays equal unless added or removed).
Examples-
* Arcane: Shapeshift, Water to Wine, Changing hair color, Invisibility
* Spiritual: Alter Mood, Spirit Healing, Auras of(Emotions [Courage, Fear, Anger, Sadness, Trust, etc.], Defense, Offense)


*Note to Game Master / World Builder:* For low magic worlds, we suggest using wild magic as the only magic and setting a Critical success rule to acquire the skill. In non magic worlds, omit all three types of magic.
